description: |
  Homeless encampments and enforcement actions by the city of San Francisco.

notes: |
  This spreadsheet is likely not the actual system used for data entry by the city, but contains the static information exported by the city's database in response to a public records request.

  Each sheet represents what would be a table in a typical relational database. For example, to map which encampments have children, we would have to join the two sheets, **assessments** and the **geographical** data, by the encampment ID.
